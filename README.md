# Scraping Twitter for Tweets Under Specific Hashtags
 

- `README.md`
- Python code `script.py` for scraping Twitter using Tweepy, via the API
- Python code `frequency-analysis.py` for obtaining counts of words contained in the text of the tweets scraped

## Note: <br/>
Change the placeholder bearer token to your own account's bearer token. <br/>
Confirm file format for saving the tweets scraped as CSVs with folder names as per frequency analysis script.


The results may finally be observed, making note of the choice of words most commonly used pertaining to the issues being discussed under those hashtags. <br/> 

## 
<br/>
There are, however, limitations to this exercise. The frequency analysis does not account for how many words are repeated by a single user, or for context of the words themselves. For example, the sentences, "Blue is a nice colour," and "Saying that blue is a nice colour is wrong." are two distinctly different sentences. With that in mind, looking into context, as well as users' patterns on Twitter is further scope for study.
